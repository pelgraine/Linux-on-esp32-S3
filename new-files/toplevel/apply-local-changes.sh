#!/bin/bash
# Applies this project's local modifications (AP support, NAT/DNS, security
# hardening, espctl, 16MB board profile) on top of a freshly cloned upstream
# tree. Called automatically by rebuild-esp32s3-linux-wifi.sh right after
# each clone, before that source is built -- see the two call sites there.
#
# Why this exists: build/ (buildroot, esp-hosted, the kernel source) is
# fetched fresh from upstream on a clean checkout and is not itself part of
# this repo. Without this script, a clean checkout (including inside Docker)
# reproduces jcmvbkbc's original project, not this one -- the local patches
# were being applied by hand, once per session, and never wired into the
# automated flow, which is the gap this closes.
#
# The kernel driver patch (AP support in esp32-ng) is NOT applied here: it's
# wired directly into buildroot via BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH in
# configs/esp32s3_devkit_c1_16m_defconfig, so buildroot re-applies it after
# every kernel extraction automatically, including re-extractions triggered
# mid-session. That one file class kept getting silently reverted when it
# depended on "just don't touch this directory" instead.

# Usage: apply-local-changes.sh buildroot|esp-hosted
