#
#   - a native build leaves an esp32-linux-build/ directory with build/ inside
#     it, and that is what gets passed here;
#   - the Docker build mounts a host directory *as* build/, so all that exists
#     afterwards is build-output/ -- the build directory itself, with no parent
#     to point at. Passing it used to fail with "…/build-output/build does not
#     exist", which reads like the build never ran.
#
# So: if the argument has a build/ inside it, use that; if the argument looks
# like a build directory itself, use it directly.
